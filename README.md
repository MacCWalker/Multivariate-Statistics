# Applied Multivariate Statistics 

Final-year statistics projects in multivariate statistics, completed in R. 

## Projects Include... 

### 1) Carillon Bell Analysis

This project looks at the relationship between the physical characteristics of the Cape Town carillon bells and their varying acoustics. With a focus on identifying key patterns and group differences in frequency deviations and bell dimensions. 

#### Flow of Key Tasks: 

* <ins>Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)</ins> – Examined the relationship between year/dimensions of bells and their tonal frequencies, interpreting canonical loadings, correlations, and identifying outliers via score plots.

* <ins>Multivariate Levene’s Test</ins> – Tested equality of covariance matrices across bell size groups (smallest, medium, largest) for bells made in 1925, using plots to visualise results.

* <ins>Multivariate Normality</ins> – Assessed Mahalanobis distances, conducted chi-squared goodness-of-fit tests, and produced diagnostic plots to evaluate group normality assumptions.

* <ins>MANOVA & Permutation Testing</ins> – Investigated differences in tonal deviations between bell size groups, choosing test method based on findings from covariance and normality checks, and interpreting results in context.

### 2) School Character Analysis

This project unpacks data from the New Zealand TIMMS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) 2023, school principal survey. The aim being to explore if there is a relationship between how school location influences school character ratings. 

#### Flow of Key Tasks: 

* <ins>Manhattan vs Euclidean Distances</ins>  – Constructed examples with equal Manhattan distances but differing Euclidean distances; discussed metric implications.

* <ins>Metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)</ins>  – Determined optimal dimensionality for visualising data; assessed axis interpretability and importance.

* <ins>MDS Plots by Location</ins>  – Created facetted MDS plots and summarised group distributions to explore visible differences between locations.

* <ins>PERMANOVA</ins>  – Tested for significant location-based differences, interpreting results alongside visual inspection.

* <ins>Composite Scoring Evaluation</ins>  – Assessed correlation between summed “school character” score and MDS axes; evaluated validity of simplifying to one aggregate metric.
